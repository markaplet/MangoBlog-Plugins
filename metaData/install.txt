To install metaData, simply copy the metaData folder into the folder:

MangoBlog/components/plugins/user

Then log into your administrator, go into Add-ons, and Activate metaData.

Once active, metaData adds a link to the settings page titled "metaData" 

Currently metaData only accepts keyword metadata. Later versions will add additional support for other types of meta data.
